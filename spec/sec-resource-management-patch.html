    <p>An interface is a set of property keys whose associated values match a specific specification. Any object that provides all the properties as described by an interface's specification <em>conforms</em> to that interface. An interface is not represented by a distinct object. There may be many separately implemented objects that conform to any interface. An individual object may conform to multiple interfaces.</p>
